This folder contains all PDF Score Annotations for Haydn string quartet movements.
Each file title contains the opus number, the quartet number and the movement number.
Each file contains a legend to interpret annotations:
Melody is highlighted in grey when all annotators agree and in different colours when they do not: A1 = yellow; A2 = green; A3 = pink.
Each disagreement is labelled into one of seven categories:
1. Competing saliency: high voice
2. Competeing saliency: thematic
3. Call/response: overlapping
4. Call/response: non-overlapping
5. Dovetailing
6. Voicing
7. Other
All of these disagreement categories are explained further in the accompanying paper, along with an analysis of their frequency.
