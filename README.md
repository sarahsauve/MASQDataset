Melody Annotated String Quartet Dataset - ground truth for melody extraction
This repository contains PDF Score annotations and MIDI files of melodies as annotated by three listeners for a selection of Haydn and Mozart string quartet movements, along with the pre-peer-reviewed accompanying paper describing the dataset with analysis of discrepancies. This dataset will grow over time with the goal of providing annotations for all string quartet movements uploaded to the KernScores website.
