This folder contains all MIDI files for Haydn string quartets.
Each file title indicates the opus number, the quartet number, the movement number and the annotator number.
Each of these files contains the melody of a string quartet movement as perceived by a musically knowledgeable annotator, where they highlighted the melody on a score as they listened. Annotators were instructed to choose only one note at a time and to leave the score unmarked if they did not consider any note at that time melodic.
