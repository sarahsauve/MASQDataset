This folder contains all MIDI files for Mozart string quartets.
Each file title indicates the K catalog number, the movement number and the annotator number.
Each of these files contains the melody of a string quartet movement as perceived by a musically knowledgeable annotator, where they highlighted the melody on a score as they listened. Annotators were instructed to choose only one note at a time and to leave the score unmarked if they did not consider any note at that time melodic.
